# RISC-V_CPU

RISC-V_CPU is an open-source, industry-grade implementation of a RISC-V
processor core written in synthesizable Verilog. The project follows
professional RTL design, verification, and documentation practices suitable
for ASIC and FPGA development.

## Features
- RISC-V Base ISA (RV32I)
- Modular and clean RTL architecture
- Synthesizable and lint-friendly design
- Verification-ready structure
- Open-source and extensible

## Getting Started
Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ArjunPShetty/RISC-V_CPU.git
